multicurl - Poor man's axel
v1, Aug 27 2011

Copyright (c) 2011 gnuzip@gmail.com. Licensed under New BSD.

Usage:
    multicurl.sh [-c cookies(cookies.txt)] [-e filename encoding] [-n threads(5)] [-o output] url
    For more parameters, edit the code in multicurl.sh.

Bugs:
  - The downloaded filename can't contain newlines.
  - Only one URL can be processed at a time.
  - Only enabled for http/https. Parallel ftp downloading is probably not a good idea.
  - Thread number can't be changed for the same download.
  - Filename may be corrupted by dash (<0.5.6.1), cf. http://bugs.debian.org/532302

Prerequisites:
    dash curl iconv grep coreutils xargs pgrep kill
